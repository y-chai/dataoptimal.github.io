I am a Chinese national and received my MS degree in plant pathology and PhD in applied economics, both at the University of Minnesota. As a pathologist I studied rust resistance genetics in barley. As an economist my research focuses on agricultural innovation, production, productivity, and the bio-economics of crop varietal change and production risk.  

**Research area**:  

* **Agricultural Risk Management**  
Agricultural production is an intrinsically risky business that constantly faces many sources of risks, such as production risks, market risks, institutional risks, and personal risks. To cope with agricultural risks, farmers rely on a number of technical and institutional options, including a variety of farm management practices, fertilizer and pesticide use, irrigation, disease monitoring, as well as crop insurance. My current research takes an integrated, bio-economic approach to assessing the role of these various risk management strategies in improving farmersâ€™ welfare and helping to secure global food supplies.
