## Project Description
*Halyomorpha halys* (brown marmorated stink bug, BMSB) is native to China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, but has spread through North America since its first US detection in 1996. Climatic suitablity studies have indicated that southern Minnesota may be under establishment risk. The goal of this project is to develop a high-resolution spatially explicit *H. halys* dispersal modelling framework to support decision makers in planning for the prevention, control or eradication of *H. halys*.  

## Time Period
October, 2018 to April, 2022

## Sponsoring Organization
[Minnesota Invasive Terrestrial Plants and Pests Center (MITPPC)](https://mitppc.umn.edu/), University of Minnesota 

## Activities
* **Activity 1**. Develop a high resolution, spatially explicit, agent-based dispersal model for *H. halys*  
* **Activity 2**. Develop a bio-economic modeling framework to assess economic resource vulnerability to the risk of *H. halys* invasion  
* **Activity 3**. Undertake a Value of Information (VoI) analysis by comparing the predicted resource outcomes of the proposed detailed *H. halys* invasion-intervention scenarios with results from less parametrized invasion and intervention scenarios.
