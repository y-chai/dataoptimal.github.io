## Project Description
As a joint project between [GEMS Informatics Center](https://agroinformatics.org/) and [2Blades](https://2blades.org/), the goal of this project is to assess the global burden of crop losses attributed to wheat microbial diseases.

## Time Period
August 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021

## Personnel
**PI**: Philip Pardey (ppardey@umn.edu)
**Co-PI**: Yuan Chai (chaix026@umn.edu)
**Co-PI**: Senait Senay (ssenay@umn.edu)
**Research Support**: Connie Chan-Kang (chan0576@umn.edu)

## Activities
* **Activity 1**. Global multi-peril risk and loss assessment of wheat microbial diseases
* **Activity 2**. Estimates of wheat yield losses associated with each of the respective diseases
* **Activity 3**. Estimates of the global investments in wheat/crop pathology R&D
* **Activity 4**. Probabilistic assessment of the economically justifiable investment in R&D
* **Activity 5**. Policy brief on the economic assessment of the investment implications for wheat microbial diseases worldwide
